### About

The purpose of this build was to solidify and practice my skills with plain JavaScript. After weeks of working constantly with React.js during my time at school, I did not want to slowly forget the fundamentals.

### Key Learnings

Main challenge was to get in the mindset of why I wanted to build this in the first place. Often times I would be too focused on how something may look when the overall challenge would be to make the functionality work. It is definitely a learn in progress, but I am progressing nonetheless.

Since I was utilizing React so much, I had troubles reminding myself that the 'onclick' attribute is not camelCase in vanillaJS. Furthermore, with this practice, I was able to learn more about DOM manipulation and how you can add or delete certain things depending on what has been specified.
